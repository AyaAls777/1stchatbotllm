# Chatbot LLM

A simple chatbot built using Groq’s LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instant API. Created during the AI Residency to demonstrate LLM prompt-response flow using Python, Postman, and Gradio.

### Features
- API was first configured using Postman based on Groq’s documentation
- Sends user prompts to the LLaMA model via Groq API
- Displays real-time responses in a Gradio interface
- Uses environment variable for secure API key handling

### Stack
- Python
- Postman
- Gradio
- Requests
- Groq API

This was my first chatbot project built while learning how to configure and integrate LLM APIs from scratch.
